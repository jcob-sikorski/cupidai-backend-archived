test extensively comfyui endpoint in terms of image formats

midjourney action for testing after buying a plan

add paramters to facefusion, midjourney, comfyui to make generated images/videos superior quality

figure out what should be returned type of each endpoint + what's the structure of responses for frontend

add extensive print statements in lowercase for each tested endpoint - we must know everything

during testing modify the request fields to be exaclty the fields we need instead of models - these models are confusing

run holistic and detailed tests for every endpoint once again

make the switch for production and development variables in code

add logs



host image generation on runpod - use prebuild image from their site during pod config then remove it and install from github

test midjourney action, imagine, faceswap after buying a plan
