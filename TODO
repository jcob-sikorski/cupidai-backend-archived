# TODO: what about other file formats like movies or jpgs for image generation: uploads, generation, which one are interacting with these formats
#       how we handle downloads, uploads, removals

############################################## IMAGE GENERATION ##############################################

make comfyui also for formats: jpg, png, mov, mp4, HEIC

test extensively facefusion endpoint
test jpg, png, mov, mp4, HEIC file formats in facefusion

test extensively comfyui endpoint in terms of image formats

add second api

run facefusion deepfake on the same runpod as comfyui.
          the fastapi server would be the same communciating with both comfy and faceufusion (probably? what's the best option for us in the future to keep it simple?)

host image generation on runpod - use prebuild image from their site during pod config then remove it and install from github

midjourney action for testing after buying a plan

run tests for imagine, action midjourney, faceswap

add paramters to facefusion, midjourney, comfyui to make generated images/videos superior quality

figure out what should be returned type of each endpoint + what's the structure of responses for frontend


before frontend integration run holistic and detailed tests for every endpoint once again


invitation + acceptance
