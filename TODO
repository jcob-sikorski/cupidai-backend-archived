############################################## IMAGE GENERATION ##############################################

HIGH LEVEL GOALS FOR TODAY:
- figure out what should be returned type of each endpoint
- add extensive print statements in lowercase for each tested endpoint - we must know everything
- during testing modify the request fields to be exaclty the fields we need instead of BaseModel models - these models are confusing
- run holistic and detailed tests for every endpoint once again

make the switch for production and development variables in code

add logs

test akool video + mov, mp4, HEIC



host image generation on runpod - use prebuild image from their site during pod config then remove it and install from github

test midjourney action, imagine, faceswap after buying a plan

add some parameters to make images/videos superior quality time is not key, quality and reliability is for our customers

before frontend integration run holistic and detailed tests for every endpoint once again
